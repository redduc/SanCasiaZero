# SanCasiaZero
A entity component system + game engine

# Goal
The goal of this project is not to write a general purpouse game engine or a super fast ecs. 
It rather is to building a basic understanding of entity components systems and the way modern game engins work.

Hopefully this will also help others as well.

## Car Game
"Car Game" was one my first bigger projects I had as a application developer.
It is a relativly simple game based on OO Java.
The player maneuvers a car through traffic, trying not to dump into other vehicles.
On both sides of the street were walkways where people walked.
The player was able to drive on there but would risk running over the pedestrians.
This would come at great cost - about 50% of the score. However the game would still continue.
